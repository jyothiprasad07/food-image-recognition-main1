# food image recognition


Overview

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to develop a deep learning model for recognizing various food images. The model is trained on a dataset of food images, enabling it to accurately classify and identify different types of cuisine.

Description

The food image recognition system consists of the following components:

1. Dataset: A comprehensive collection of food images, categorized by type (e.g., pizza, sushi, burgers).
2. Data Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
3. CNN Model: A deep neural network architecture (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) trained on the food image dataset.
4. Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

Features

- Accurate food image classification
- Support for various food categories
- Scalable and efficient architecture
